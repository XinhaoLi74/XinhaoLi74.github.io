## Research Papers ðŸŽ“

### Cheminformatics
**[Visualization of very large high-dimensional data sets as minimum spanning trees](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-0416-x)**. [TMAP] is a new data visualization method designed for visualizing large, high-dimensional data sets containing chemical structures and associated properties while preserving both global and local features.

**Exploring chemical space using natural language processing methodologies for drug discovery** [Drug Discov Today](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644620300465?via%3Dihub) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06053). 
> Text-based representations of chemicals and proteins can be thought of as unstructured languages codified by humans to describe domain-specific knowledge. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) methodologies in the processing of spoken languages accelerated the application of NLP to elucidate hidden knowledge in textual representations of these biochemical entities and then use it to construct models to predict molecular properties or to design novel molecules. This review outlines the impact made by these advances on drug discovery and aims to further the dialogue between medicinal chemists and computer scientists.


### NLP

[REALM : Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training]

[Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05507)

[ImageBERT: CROSS-MODAL PRE-TRAINING WITH LARGE-SCALE WEAK-SUPERVISED IMAGE-TEXT DATA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07966). ImageBERT is a new vision-language pre-trained model for image-text joint embedding from Microsoft. The model is pre-trained on four tasks simultaneously: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Object Classification (MOC), Masked Region Feature Regression (MRFR), and Image Text Matching (ITM). Along with the pre-trained model, the team also collected a Large-scale weAk-supervised Image-Text (LAIT) dataset from Web. One interesting finding of this paper is that **multi-stage pre-training strategy outperforms single-stage pre-training**.

## Software and Tools ðŸ’» 

[TMAP]

[Mol Frame](https://github.com/apahl/mol_frame)

[Computer Vision Recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes). Best practices for computer vision from Microsoft. The goal for this repository is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in Computer Vision algorithms, neural architectures, and operationalizing such systems. This project is drawn from existing state-of-the-art libraries and build additional utility around loading image data, optimizing and evaluating models, and scaling up to the cloud. **The examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks and common utility functions**. All examples use **Pytorch** as the underlying deep learning library.
