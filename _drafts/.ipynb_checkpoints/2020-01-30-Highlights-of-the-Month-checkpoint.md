### An algorithm to identify functional groups in organic molecules [[Journal of Cheminformatics]](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0225-z)
**Functional Groups (FGs)** are sets of connected atoms that determine the properities and reactivity of a molecule. Software systems to identify functional groups are mainly based on a predefined list of substructures. The author proposed an algorithm can atuomate extract the funcitonal groups in a molecule without any pre-defined substructures. An analysis of ChEMBL database was implemented and 3,080 functional groups were found. A following study of analyzing functional groups occurring in Natural Products can be found [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b01022).

### Rethinking drug design in the artificial intelligence era [[Nature Communications]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-019-0050-3)
*Can artificial intelligence help us design better small-molecule drug candidates faster?* In this perspective, the authors discussed *five* **'grand challenges'** that need to be addressed in order to make the drug design with AI successful in the long run: 
- Obtaining appropriate datasets
    - understanding of the technical error and biological variability associated with the underlying data.
    - accidental misreporting of data
    - missing values
    - highly imbalanced with either large numbers of inactive compounds and small numbers of active compounds, or vice versa.
    - The questions of whether a compound is â€˜active against a targetâ€™ or â€˜toxicâ€™ are much more complex and labeled with much greater difficulty and nuances
- Generating new hypotheses
    - what to make next? Mainly driven by human creativity and 'chemical intuition'.
- Optimizing in a multi- objective manner
- Reducing cycle times
- **Changing the research culture and creating an appropriate mindset.**

In addition to the five 'grand challenges', the authors also discussed some other areas where AI might be relevant to drug discovery:
- Data curation and the identification of potential mistakes in data reporting.
- How to represent molecules and proteins in a way that is most amenable to leveraging the full power of current machine learning tasks such as predictive modelling and generative models
- The applicability of AI for drug design from scratch in low- data situations is yet to be shown
- A key opportunity to encourage the uptake of AI approaches is to identify areas in which AI can augment and support (rather than replace) chemists and drug designers to make their processes more productive
- It will be essential to design AI systems in a way that allows them to observe and learn from human behaviour in feedback cycles that are deemed beneficial for both sides.

### How to (Not) Get a Job in Science

In this [blog post](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2020/01/how-to-not-get-job-in-science.html), **Patrick Walters** provides some really useful suggestions based on his experiences of more than 20 years a hiring manager in organizations ranging from small biotech to medium-sized pharma:
> - Be realistic about your experience.
> - The way that you approach a problem is far more critical than the specific problems youâ€™ve worked on.
> - list your publications and provide hyperlinks: papers, preprints, posters, slides.
> - Your **cover letter and answers to website questions** are very important.  
> - Netrwork! Netrwork! Netrwork! **It isnâ€™t easy, but itâ€™s doable.**
    - Go to conferences and present a poster.
    - Get in torch with people who are doing work that you find interesting.
    - Publish
    - Make something useful. 
    - Use social media
