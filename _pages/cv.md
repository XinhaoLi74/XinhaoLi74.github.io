Summary
======
3rd year Ph.D. student in Chemistry. Experienced in applying machine learning techniques and cheminformatics for solving chemistry problems, e.g. molecular activity/propriety prediction. Well-versed in programming languages including Python and R. Proficient skills in chemical data mining, curation, analysis, visualization, and modeling. 

Research Interests by Keyworks
======
* Cheminformatics
* Computational Toxicology
* Machine Learning/Deep learning
* Big Data Mining, Analysis, Visulzation	
* QSAR modeling
* Computer-Aided Drug Design
* Virtual Screening
* Software Development

Research
======

* Development of Novel Quantitative Structure-Property/Activity Relationship (QSPR/QSAR) Modeling Methodologies:
    * MolPMoFiT: An inductive transfer learning method for QSRR/QSAR modeling. MolPMoFiT pre-trained a universal molecular structure prediction model using one million bioactive molecules from ChEMBL and then fine-tuned it for various QSPR/QSAR tasks. 
    * Hierarchical QSAR: An effective ensemble modeling method that Integrating binary/multi classification and regression models for predicting acute oral systemic toxicity.
* Software Development:
    * CryptoChem:  A novel cryptographic and data storage method based on cheminformatics, machine learning, and big chemical data. Two independent software were developed: MOLWRITE and MOLREAD. MOLWRITE encrypts the text/image data into chemical message and MOLREAD decrypts the encoded chemical message back to text/image.
